fl3xbl0w is an attempt to document as much as possible on the "Bowflex Console" (what Nautilus refers to as `Vantron`), which drives most of the "smart devices" from Bowflex (basically, an Android tablet running proprietary software).

This relies on some previous work provided over [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bowflex/comments/mi8wdo/unlocking_bowflex_velocore/) (thanks [xasmx](https://www.reddit.com/user/xasmx/)!) to achieve a deeper understanding on the machine's software & hardware.

## fl3xbl0w is now located at [barrenechea.cl](https://barrenechea.cl/projects/fl3xbl0w/) !

The codebase (if you'd like to contribute to) is now located alongside my other projects over [here](https://github.com/SebastianBar/barrenechea-website/tree/main/src/pages/projects).
